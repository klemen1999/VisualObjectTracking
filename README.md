# VisualObjectTracking

Implementation of 5 different tracking algorithms:
 - [Mean Shift tracker](./MeanShift/)
 - [MOSSE - Correlation Filter tracker](./MOSSE/)
 - [Particle filter - Bayes Recursive Filter](./ParticleFilter/)
 - [SiamFC - Short and Long term tracker](./SiamFC/)

Each one of them also includes final report where different parameters and possible upgrades are discussed. For evaluation VOT2013 and VOT2014 is used.
